# Single Page Website with BEM Methodology

## Project Description

This repository contains a simple single-page website created as part of a test assignment for the Open Frontend Academy by Muse Group. The website demonstrates the use of BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for organizing CSS, and includes several features aimed at showcasing frontend development skills.

## Features

- **BEM Methodology:** The website's CSS is organized using the BEM naming convention to ensure modularity and reusability.
- **Normalize.css:** The project includes Normalize.css to provide consistent styling across different browsers.
- **Flexbox Layout:** All elements are positioned using Flexbox for a responsive and flexible layout.
- **Interactive Elements:** Buttons and links feature `hover`, `focus`, and `active` states for better user interaction.
- **Input Validation:** A JavaScript file handles the validation of an email input field using regular expressions (***@.com/***@.ru allowed).
- **Responsive Design:** Media queries are used to ensure the website is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.
